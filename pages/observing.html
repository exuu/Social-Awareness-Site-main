        <div id="empathyContent"> Observing is linked with listening as when we observe, we need to look for non-verbal cues, and to listen well.
    
    Here are some ways to observe bettter:
            <ul><li title="Why we should stop talking to observe better, is so that there will be no interruptions for the speaker allowing them to speak what they feel or think, and so that you can listen better, as you wont be thinking of what you have to say and just listen.">Stop talking</li><li title="It is good to have a internal monologue, but not so good when listening or observing to another person, we should stop it, so we can focus on what they are showing or speaking, like body gestures, or tone of voice, so that we will not be distracted. ">Stop the monoluge in our minds</li><li title="It is nice to predict the point the other person is about to make, but sometimes it is not, we should keep quiet until she is done speaking, or showing her point, as when we predict we might predict the wrong thing, leading to an argument or a misunderstanding.">Stop trying to predict the point the speaker is about to make</li><li title="What I mean by this is that you should keep quiet and listen and not think of what you're going to say next so that you can fully be attentive, and observe them while they're speaking.">Stop thinking ahead of what you're going to say next</li><li title="Imagine a scenario where a frend is having a rough time and you dont seem to understand how they are feeling, you shoul step into their shoes, or imagine what they have gone through, if it was you instead of them, try to feel what you have felt and see if they feel that way, so that you may empathize, and observe how they are feeling.
