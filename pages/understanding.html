        <div id="empathyContent"> Understanding others does not mean that you have to agree with their feelings or point of view. Instead, it means that you recognise their point of view, and accept that it is different from yours. You may still have to do difficult things that others do not agree with.
    
Here are some ways to become more understanding:
            <ul><li title="Dont be curious in a weird and creepy way, but be curious in a way that you want to understand them better, which can be dome by asking things such as what are their hobbies, or their feelings, etc.">Be curious about the person you want to be more understanding to</li><li title="We don't assume things when trying to be more understanding as what we have &quot;assumend&quot; may be incorrect and may even seem as disrespectful to the other person as you don care to understand the point they are giving.">Don't always assume things</li><li title="We need to listen well and pick up their emotional cues so that we dont get the wrong idea or interpretation of what they are feeling, whether that may be sadness, or frustration, we need to do our bests in listening, and understanding what they are going through.">Listen well and pick up emotional cues</li><l title="We need to show sensetivity, or be sensetive ourselves so that we can show them that we understand what they are feeling and what they went through, and make them know that you are there for them, and that you understand their persepctives, and how the feel or what they think about an something, someone, or somewhere."i>Show sensetivity and understand their persepctives</li><li title="We help the person based on our understanding of their needs and emotions, such as comfort in sadness, or spending time in happiness, or acknowledging their feelings in anger. Helping them based on what they are showing, helps us to be a more understanding person, not just to othres, but to ourselves too.">Helping other appropriately</li>
