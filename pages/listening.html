        <div id="empathyContent"> Listening is the skill to accurately recieve and interpret messages in communicating with someone. Listening is the most important part in social awareness, because without it, what other people mean are misunderstood and often leads to arguments.
    Sometimes, it is better if we just listen and not say anything at all, but if we just listen and not show them that we are listening, they might get irritated or annoyed and they won't tell you anything.
    
    Here are some ways to improve your listening skill:
            <ul><li title="We keep eye contact with the speaker because this shows them that you are attentively listening to them and this helps you to focus on the conversation and read their facial expressions.">Maintain Eye Contact with your speaker</li><li  title="Interrupting a person speaking, shows them that you don't care that they are trying to say, or what they are going through. And another important factor is the tone of your voice when speaking, if you speak loudly or angrily, it is also another way that shows them that you do not really care and  are just being fake.">Don't interrupt and adjusting your tone </li><li  title="Nonverbal cues such as eye contact, gestures, posture, body movements, and the tone of voice. These signals show information or support what they are trying to tell, that they have not spoken and is one of the best ways to improve your listening.">Pay attention to nonverbal cues</li><li  title="Limiting your judgments or not being judgemental shows that we care to listen and will try not to get distracted by personal feelings or thoughts, and also restricting our judgments restricts our reactions which may seem inappropriate in certain situations, and is better to just continue listneing and respecting th em. Because listening without judgement allows the speaker to feel heard, or that someone is really listening to them, but including to being non judgmental also includes our posture, and gestures, e.g: crossing your arms, keeping a closed body position.">Limiting judgments</li>
